# Tears, Despair & Debugging – Project 04

CMP_SC / INFO_TC 3330  
Spring 2025  
Brock Burchett + Eric Hudson

## Status

Just getting started on this — setting up the repo and adding my teammate. Planning to structure the project soon and then build it out based on the test cases we were given. This will be done using test-driven development (TDD), so we’ll be making sure everything works with the existing JUnit5 tests.

## Plan

Here’s a rough outline of what we’ll do:

- [ ] Set up folder structure with packages and classes
- [ ] Create enums for `Component` and `Direction`
- [ ] Build the `Cell`, `Grid`, and `Agent` classes
- [ ] Implement the simulation with a `main()` method
- [ ] Pass all the JUnit5 tests
- [ ] Clean up code, add Javadoc and submit

## Goal

Get the agent to escape the randomly generated grid by navigating through APERTURES and reaching the EXIT on the leftmost column. Every cell must have at least one APERTURE. Game ends when the agent moves LEFT from the EXIT cell.

## Notes

- Using Git for version control — committing small and meaningful changes.
- Will be working on this throughout the week leading up to the 4/22 deadline.
- Once we start building out the logic, I’ll update this README with how everything works.

More updates soon once we have something built!
